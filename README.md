# Virtual Robot Challenge: Simulation Task

Welcome to the repository for the simulation task of the Virtual Robot Challenge. In this task, we designed a virtual robot using the Webots Open-Source Simulator (Version R2021b) to complete a series of subtasks..

## Task Overview

The simulation task involves designing a virtual robot capable of completing the following subtasks:

1. Line Following
2. Segmented Wall Following
3. Dotted Line Following
4. Chess Board Puzzle

## Subtask Details

### Line Following

The robot must accurately follow a white line on a black surface. The path may include straight and curved lines.

### Segmented Wall Following

The robot should follow a segmented wall with varying shapes, such as straight or curved segments.

### Dotted Line Following

The robot must follow a colored dotted line path. The path has two options, and the correct one should be chosen based on a random color assigned at the beginning of the task.

### Chess Board Puzzle

The robot plays the role of a black rook in a chess game. It needs to deliver checkmate in one move and open a secret chamber door on a virtual chessboard.

## Broken Bridge Crossing

After completing the Chess Board Puzzle, the robot's next challenge is to cross a broken bridge. The bridge is divided into two sections, each with a hole. The robot must place two blocks to cover these holes and create a path to the destination square. The two bloks can find in the chamber after we complete the sub task on chess board arena.

### Specifications

- The width of the bridge is 40 cm.
- Each hole measures 11 cm x 15 cm with the shorter side parallel to the guide line.
- The holes have a depth of 10.5 cm.
- The robot should carry two cubes, each with dimensions 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm and a weight of 150g.

### Crossing Procedure

1. The robot needs to approach the bridge and position the cubes to cover the holes.
2. The blocks must be carefully placed to ensure stability and proper coverage.
3. Once the holes are covered, the robot will be able to cross the bridge safely.
4. The robot's objective is to stop inside the white destination square after crossing the bridge.
